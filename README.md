# Test repository for testing the operation of web sockets and transferring an image (video) between the client and the server + rendering this image

## My script for transmitting video over socket with openCV 
- Serializer/Deserializer -> Byte/Numpy.array with -> Pickle
- Web socket -> default python socket
- Camera connect with -> openCV
